\chapter*{Abstract}
Process analyses are almost standard for companies today. However, the question often arises as to how a change actually affects the process. Exactly such questions can usually be answered with the methods of business intelligence. However, the answers are often complex and not always clear. Even though one often hears about causal relationships, it is not always clear whether it is just a matter of correlation. However, machine learning could help where less mathematically skilled individuals fail. Therefore, this project is concerned with the application of dual machine learning, a method causal analysis, and considering process change as causes.
