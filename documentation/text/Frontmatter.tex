\chapter*{Abstract}
Process analyses are almost standard for companies today. The question often arises as to how a change actually affects the process. Precisely such questions can usually be answered using business intelligence methods. However, the answers are often complex and not always clear. Even though one often hears about causal relationships, it is not always clear whether it is just a correlation. Machine learning, however, could help where less mathematically savvy individuals fail. Therefore, this project addresses the application of double machine learning, a method for causal analysis, and the consideration of process changes as causes.
